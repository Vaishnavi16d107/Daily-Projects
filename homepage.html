			<h5>Screening Services</h5>
			<p><font  size="2">It is the responsibility of governments to assure a safe and sufficient supply of
			blood and blood products for all patients requiring transfusion (1). Each country
			should formulate a national blood policy and plan, as part of the national health
			policy, to define how safe blood and blood products will be made available and
			accessible to address the transfusion needs of its population, including how
			blood transfusion services will be organized and managed. </font></p></fieldset>
			<fieldset><h6>Constraints and challenges</h6>
			<p><font size="1">Countries that are still unable to screen all donated blood for TTIs in a qualityassured manner face a variety of constraints. At national level, the main challenges
			are often ineffective policies, lack of national standards or screening strategies, and
			limited resources for implementing the national blood screening programme. </font></p></fieldset>
